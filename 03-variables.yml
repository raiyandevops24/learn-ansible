# same like shell you care accessing variable with prefix $, here variable will be under {{ }}
# if the value starts with variable, then it requires quotes and we can use any single or double quotes.
# unlike shell, here in ansible single or double quote does not have any difference.

# variable precedence
# 1. CLI - e variable
# 2. roles vars
# 3. vars_files
# 4. vars - from play book
# n. roles_defaults
